# Portfolio Website
This is code for my portfolio website written in Next.js. The website is hosted on a Azure Virtual Machine and live at [https://www.divyanshugangwar.in](https://www.divyanshugangwar.in)

## Getting Started

Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Divyanshu23/divyanshu-portfolio-website.git
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

After the production build is ready, configure your server using Nginx or Apache or others, point your domain to host's IP and done.
